I am now a PhD candidate at the [ILLC](http://www.illc.uva.nl/), [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/en/home/) under the supervision of [Johan van Benthem](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.vanbenthem/), [Sonja Smets](http://sonja.tiddlyspot.com/#HOME) and [Fenrong Liu](http://www.fenrong.net/). Meanwhile, I am affiliated with the [Tsinghua University - University of Amsterdam Joint Research Centre for Logic](http://tsinghualogic.net/JRC/) in Beijing. My current research interest lies in formal epistemology, in particular the relation between human reasoning and belief.
